basic notes:
- make utility and Makefiles provide a build system that can be used to manage the compilation and re-compilation of programs that are written in any programming language. It is useful for automating the build process
- CMake is a cross-platform Makefile generator!

Examples:
- Example 1: use CMake for building a C++ project with multiple headers and source files
- Example 2: same as Example 1, but instead of generating an executable file, generate a shared library
